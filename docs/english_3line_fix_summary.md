# English 3-Line Title Height Fix

## Problem Description

When generating English titles with 3 lines, the last line was being cut off because the background image height wasn't being adjusted properly. The Chinese title generation had special height adjustment logic, but English titles only used the generic multi-line handling, which didn't provide sufficient vertical space.

## Root Cause

In `youtube_thumbnail_generator/text_png_generator.py`, the `create_text_png()` function had height adjustment logic specifically for Chinese titles (lines 231-241):

```python
# Original code - only for Chinese
if is_title and language == 'chinese':
    if num_lines == 1:
        height = 160  # 1行中文标题：160px高度
    elif num_lines == 2:
        height = 260  # 2行中文标题：260px高度
    else:  # 3行
        height = 360  # 3行中文标题：360px高度
elif num_lines > 1:
    # English titles went to generic handling - insufficient height
```

English titles fell through to the generic `elif num_lines > 1:` case, which didn't provide enough height for 3-line titles.

## Solution Applied

Extended the height adjustment logic to include English titles with the same height values:

```python
# Fixed code - includes both Chinese and English
if is_title and language == 'chinese':
    # Chinese title height adjustment
    if num_lines == 1:
        height = 160
    elif num_lines == 2:
        height = 260
    else:  # 3行
        height = 360
elif is_title and language == 'english':
    # English title height adjustment (NEW)
    if num_lines == 1:
        height = 160  # 1-line English title: 160px height
    elif num_lines == 2:
        height = 260  # 2-line English title: 260px height
    else:  # 3 lines
        height = 360  # 3-line English title: 360px height (FIX)
elif num_lines > 1:
    # Other cases use generic handling
```

Also updated the margin adjustment logic to apply to both Chinese and English titles:

```python
# Before: Only Chinese titles got special margin treatment
if is_title and language == 'chinese':

# After: Both Chinese and English titles get special margin treatment  
if is_title and (language == 'chinese' or language == 'english'):
```

## Height Allocation Breakdown

| Lines | Height | Top Margin | Available Text Area |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| 1     | 160px  | 45px       | 70px              |
| 2     | 260px  | 40px       | 180px             |
| 3     | 360px  | 35px       | 290px             |

## Files Changed

1. **`youtube_thumbnail_generator/text_png_generator.py`**
   - Lines 242-252: Added English title height adjustment logic
   - Lines 270-278: Extended margin adjustment to include English titles

## Test Results

✅ **Test Passed**: English 3-line titles now get proper 360px height allocation  
✅ **Visual Verified**: Last line no longer cut off  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Chinese title logic unchanged  
✅ **No Regression**: 1-line and 2-line English titles still work correctly  

### Test Output
```
1-line title height: 160px ✅
3-line title height: 360px ✅
Height difference: 200px ✅
Expected difference: 200px ✅
Height adjustment working correctly! ✅
```

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Cut-off Issue**: 3-line English titles now have sufficient vertical space
2. **Consistent Behavior**: English and Chinese titles now use the same height logic  
3. **Better UX**: No more partial text rendering in thumbnails
4. **Maintainable**: Single, consistent approach for both languages

## Usage Example

```python
from youtube_thumbnail_generator import create_generator

generator = create_generator()

# This will now work correctly without cut-off
result = generator.generate_final_thumbnail(
    title="This is a very long English title that should wrap to three lines when rendered",
    author="Author Name", 
    output_path="fixed_thumbnail.jpg"
)
```

The fix ensures that English titles with 3 lines receive the same generous height allocation (360px) that Chinese titles already had, preventing text cut-off issues.
